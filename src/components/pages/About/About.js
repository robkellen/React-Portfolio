                Full-stack web developer with a strong background of working and
                leading teams in the hospitality industry. Earned a certificate
                in full-stack development from the University of Arizona in
                October, 2020 where I developed knowledge and skills in areas
                including JavaScript, JQuery, CSS, Mongoose, Express, React,
                Node, and CSS to create responsive web applications. With
                passion and perseverance I worked within several teams to create
                various applications through agile development. Most recently I
                worked as part of a four-person team to create a MERN
                application that allows dog trainers to provide their clients
                with tangible and presentable data on the progress of their
                dogâ€™s training, and provide information for opportunities of
                continued progress. My passion to combine seamless integration
                between a creative front-end user experience and an efficient
                and secure back-end is supported by my unwavering work ethic. I
                am excited to join a like-minded team to apply and build upon my
                existing knowledge, and help build creative and serviceable
                applications.
