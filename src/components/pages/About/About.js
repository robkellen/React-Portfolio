                Full-stack web developer with a strong background of working and
                leading teams in the hospitality industry. I earned a
                certificate in full-stack development from the University of
                Arizona in October, 2020 where I developed knowledge and skills
                in areas including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, React,
                MongoDB, Node, Express and multiple front-end frameworks to
                create responsive web applications. With passion and
                perseverance I worked within several teams to create various
                applications through agile development. Most recently I worked
                as part of a four-person team to create a MERN application that
                allows dog trainers to provide their clients with tangible and
                presentable data on the progress of their dogâ€™s training, and
                provide information for opportunities of continued progress. My
                passion to combine seamless integration between a creative
                front-end user experience and an efficient and secure back-end
                is supported by my unwavering work ethic. I am excited to join a
                like-minded team to apply and build upon my existing skillset
                while helping build creative and serviceable applications.

                I reside in Cave Creek, Arizona along with my incredible wife
                and our two amazing daughters. When I'm not coding I like to
